## Notes

Image loading sometimes takes time. So the view is created without the poster of the movie only on refresh(scrolling up and down) the posters are shown.
Image has been going out of the image view area. I have resolved that by fixing the image view width and height.
It took sometime in understanding the constraints to be given to the views.
